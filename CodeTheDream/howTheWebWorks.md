# Sir Tim Bernes-Lee and URLS 
Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. In his pursuit, he standardized many of the processes needed to make computers talk to each other. Uniform Resource Locators, or URLs, are one of those processes. 

- Web pages are connected using whats called hyperlinks 
    behind every hyperlink is a URL 
     blue underlined words, images, buttons  

1. Clean URLS eliminate everything, except: 
    The domain name  

# Domain Names and IP addresses 

- Top level Domains 
    Are managed by icann.org
    .com 
    .net
    .edu 
    .org 
  * country codes 
    .uk 
    .jp
    .us
  * brand names 
    .online
    .inc
    .shopping  

Everything on the internet uses 
  Internet Protocol Version 4 
  IPv4 is comprised of four numbers, each between 0 and 255, separated by dots.  
  IPv4 has the capacity to identify about 4.3 billion unique addresses, 
  but with over 7 billion people already on the planet and each person having more and 
  more devices connected to the Internet, IPv4 is quickly running out of space. 

  Luckily, there's already an alternative IP version 6 that's quickly catching on. 
  IPv6 will support every person on Earth 
  having billions of devices connected to the web at once 
  IPv6 is kind of like adding more numbers to phone numbers as the population grows. 
  Phone numbers in a country often start with just a few numbers. 
  But, as more people get phones, phone numbers get longer and then, an area 
  code is added to differentiate the same number in different geographic regions. 
  IPv6 is the new format for IP addresses and 
  gives us billions of new phone number for all of the new devices on the web

1. An example of a Top Level Domain (TDL) is 
      .com 
2. An important function of a domain names is 
    to provide an easily recognizable and memorable name for a numeric IP address 
3. Top level domains are managed by: 
    The Internet Corporations for Assigned Names and zNumbers (ICANN)


# Domain Name System 
Fun Fact: Paul Mockapetris and Jon Postel figured out the Domain Name System. 

Client --------> DNS ----------> ip adress ###.##.###.# 

DNS - manages a massive database that maps domain names to IP addresses 
    addresses book for the internet 

1. You always use the same domain name servers, no matter where your are 
    False  
      computer generally communicates with the domain name server thats closest to where your computer is located 
2. Every Doamin Namr Server knows the IP address of every website 
    False 
      name servers would have to be gigantic 
3. A domain name server is: 
     a special type of server that connects domain names with IP address

# HTTP and HTTPS 

Each request you make on the web is sent using the HyperText Transfer Protocol, or HTTP. HTTP is how clients and servers talk to each other on the web. HTTPs means the communication between the client and server are encrypted. 

HTTP Exchange, two bits of information are sent back to the clinet 
    1. Status code 
    2. Resourse you requested like webpage or file 

HTTP status codes help identofy the cause of the problem when a web page or other resource doesnt load properly 

    - 100 reponses = infromational 
    - 200 reponses = success 
    - 300 responses = redirection 
    - 400 responses = client error 
    - 500 responses = server error 

HTTPS 
  S - stands for secure and it means that communication between your clients and the server is private and encrypted  


Domain names are really just catchy versions of IP addresses and 
domain name servers make the connection between domain names and IP addresses. 
Clients ans servers are designed to talk to each other using HTTP. 
The common language they have agreed to speak, but 
none of these pieces of software have to work together so nicely.  

1. HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is: 
    how clients and servers talked to eachother on the web 
2. Web clients and web servers are designed to talk to eachother using HTTP. 
    true 
      it's a good thing they do or the web wouldn't work so ubiquitously
3. In the URL: http://teamtreehouse.com, http is the protocol (domain name/top level domain/protocol), teamtreehouse is the domain name (domain name/top level domain/protocol) and .com is the top level domain (domain name/top level domain/protocol). 
4. The internet and the web are the same thing 
    true
